I made it as an appengine app, but, at this point in time, there is no dependency on appengine technology.
It is just easy for me to start/stop it, and modify and checkout the result.

requirements:
http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Java - java appengine sdk

after you take jsbooky down on your machine, go to its folder: {JSBOOK_HOME}
and there run:
{APPENGINE_JAVA_SDK_HOME}/bin/dev_appserver.sh .

For windows users, change / in \ and .sh in .bat, i hope it will work for you.

Right now we have only the skeleton app, and 1 page.
if you want to get to work right away and make some changes to the home page, go to files:
WEB-INF/app/actions/index.js and WEB-INF/app/skins/index.html .

you have to get acquainted to ringojs way of doing server-side web things.
this page can get you up&running: http://ringojs.org/wiki/Tutorial .

of course, if you get stuck, or have a question, feel free to contact me.
